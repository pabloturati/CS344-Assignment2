## Project Description

This application provides the following functionality

- Reads directory entries
- Finds a file in the current directory based on user specified criteria
- Reads and processes the data in the chosen file
- Creates a directory
- Creates new files in the newly created directory and writes processed data to these files

## Compile instructions

This project uses GNU99 compile standards for building the executable.

### Option 1.  Using compile script

This application includes a bash script to build and deploy the runner (compileApp.sh).  To use it, make sure that this file (compileApp.sh) has execution persmissions by running:

`$ chmod +x compileApp.sh`

Once it is ready, you may execute the compile instructions by running from the project root:

`$ ./compileApp.sh`

This will generate a `movies` exectable file as output. Refer to the next section on how to run the application and pass parameters.

### Option 2.  Individual commands

Refer to the contents of `compileApp.sh` for a detailed command list on how to manually compile using command line.  Notice that this project was designed to be compiled with GNU99 standards.  Please refer to `compuleApp.sh` for details.

## Run procedure

Once the application executable has been created `movies`. It can be run as follows:

`$ ./movies <filename.csv>`

An example where the file name is: `movies_sample_1.csv` would be:

`$ ./movies movies_sample_1.csv`

Where movies_sample_file must be a comma-separated file (.csv) with the following structure and application data type interpretation:

 - **Movie Title** :: string
 - **Year** :: integer number
 - **Languages** :: string 
 - **Rating Value** :: floating point number

First line of the input file is expected to contain headers, therefore data reading starts from second line.
